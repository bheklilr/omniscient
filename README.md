Omniscient - Know what your users are doing
================================================================================

Omniscient aims to be a simple REST style server for sending user analytics to
for deployed applications.  The goal of this project is to remain small, simple,
fast, and flexible.  If your user clicks a button, you should know which button
and when.  If a user encounters a bug, you should know about it.  Know what your
users are doing so that you can make your programs work better for them.
